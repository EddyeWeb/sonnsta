    "hero_intro": "My name is Gyula Vasvári, creator of SØNNSTA windows. SØNNSTA is a special indoor window that evokes the sight and effect of natural sunlight in places where a real light source is not available. The aim of the development was to create an experience that not only provides light, but also visual depth perspective: the innovative technical solution built into the product creates the effect of a spacious, sun-drenched space, thus creating maximum illusion.",
    "hero_uniqueness": "This is what makes the handmade, custom-made SØNNSTA truly unique – the light not only illuminates, but also",

    "story_title": "The story that turned into light",
    "story_intro": "My name is Gyula Vasvári, creator of SØNNSTA windows. The idea for SØNNSTA started in a windowless basement room. A space where the lack of natural light was felt every day – and where the need arose for a window that isn't really there, yet seems completely real.",
    "story_development": "This inner motivation sparked years of development and experimentation. The goal was not simply to create a lamp, but to create a visual experience that would reflect sunlight not only as light, but also as mood and space.",
    "story_essence": "This is the essence of SØNNSTA: the structure, which is only a few centimeters thick, still appears to have depth, as if we were looking at the outside world through a real window. It is this combination of visual perspective and authentic sunlight effect that makes the product so special.",
    "story_today": "Today, SØNNSTA is not just an idea born out of personal need, but a patented innovation that can open up new perspectives anywhere. Custom-made and handcrafted, SØNNSTA windows provide the same experience in homes, offices, community or professional spaces: sunlight where it was previously impossible.",
